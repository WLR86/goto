# ScopeCLI

ScopeCLI is a simple command line interface allowing you to interact with the INDI server and control your telescope.

For now, you can slew your telescope to a specific target (Stars using Bayer designation, Messier objects, NGC objects, etc.).

Hopefully more features will be added in the future, like tracking, guiding, etc.
